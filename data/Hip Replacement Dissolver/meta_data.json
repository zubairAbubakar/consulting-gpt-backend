    "name": "Hip Replacement Dissolver",
    "Problem Statement": "This technology is a solution to the problem of safely and minimally invasively removing old or faulty hip replacements.",
    "Explanation": "This is a solution from removing old or faulty hip replacements in a minimally invasive manner. By injecting a chemical compound into a small puncture, you are able to dissolve the metallic and other non-organic compounds that make up a hip replacement. This can then be drained out as needed. This chemical compound contains nanomachines that are able to discern the difference between nonorganic and organic matter which have been trained on large language models built upon orthopedic libraries of text.",
